Three ways to put things on your GUI:

	1. put widgets on a frame
		
		- Add buttons, menus, radio buttons, etc.
		
		frame.getCOntentPane().add(myButton);
		
		- the javax.swing package has more than a dozen widget types
		
	
	2. Draw 2D graphics on a widget 
	
		- use a graphics object to paint shapes.
		
		graphics.fillOval(70,70,100,100);
		
		- you can paint a lot more than boxes and circles: the java
		2D aPI is full of fun
		
	3. Put a JPEG on a widget
	
	you can put your own images on a widget.
	
	graphics.drawImage(myPic, 10, 10, this);
