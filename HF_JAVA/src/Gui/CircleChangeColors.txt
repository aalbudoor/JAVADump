// well make the circle change colors each time you click the button.


Step 1:

the frame is built with the two widgets (your drawing panel and a button). A listener
is created and registered with the button. Then the frame is displayed and it just waits for the user to click

Step 2:

the user clicks the button and the button creates an event object and 
calls the listener's event handler

Step 3:

the event handler calls repaint() on the frame. The system calls paintComponent() on 
the drawing panel

Step 4: 

voila! a new color is painted because paintComponent() runs again, filling the circle with a random color.


Q: wait a minute.. how do you put TWO things on a frame


	- GUI layouts: putting more than one widget on a frame
	
	- by default, a frame has five regions you can add to. You can add only one thing
	to each region of a frame, That one thing might be a panel that holds three other things including a panel that holds
	two more things and.. you get the idea.
	
	// we call the two-argument add method,
	that takes a region (using a constant)
	and the widget to add to that region
	
	frame.getContentPane().add(BorderLayout.CENTER, button);
