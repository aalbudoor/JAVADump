- Layout managers control the size and locations of components nested within other components

- when you add a component to another component (sometimes referred to ad background component) the added
component is controlled by the layout manager of the background component

- A layout manager asks component for their preffered size, before making a decision about the layout.
Depending on the layout manafers policies it might respect all some or none of 
the components wishes

- The borderLayout manafer lets you add a compoent to one of sive regions. You must specify the region when 
you add the component, usinf the following syntax:
	
	add(BorderLayout.EAST, panel);

- with BorderLayout, components in the north and south get their preffered width, but not height.
The components in the center gets whatever is left over (unless you use pack())

- the pack() method is like shrink-wrap for the compoenets; it uses te full preferred size of the center component, then
determines the size of the frame using the center as a starting point, building the rest based on whats in the other regions

- FlowLayout places components left to right, top to bottom, in the order in which they are added, wrapping to a new line of components
only when the components wont fit horizontally

- FLowLayout gives components their preferred size on both dimensions

- BoxLayout lets you align compoenents stacked vertically, even if they could fit side-by-side.
Like Flowlayout, BoxLayout uses the preferred sizr of the component in both dimensions

- BorderLayout is the defualt layout manager for a frame; flowlayout is the default for a panel

- If you want a panel to use something other than flow you have to call setLayout() to the panel
