//uisng printWriter


1. Make a socket connection to the server

	Socket chatSocket = new Socket("127.0.0.1" , 5000);
	


2. Make a PrintWriter chained to the Sockets low-level (connection) outputStream

	PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(chatSocket.getOutputStream());

	- printWriter acts as its own bridge between character data and the bytes it gets from the Sockets
	low-level output Stream. By chaining a PrintWriter to the Socket's output stream, we can write Strings to the Socket Connection
	
	- The socket gives us a low-level connection stream and we chain it to the PrintWriter by
	giving it to the PrintWriter constructor
	
3. Writer (print) Something

	writer.println("message to send");		//println() adds a new line at the end of what it sends
	wrtier.print("another message"); //print() doesnt add the new line
