//To communicate over a socket connection, you use streams, just like steralization

1. Make a scoket connection to the server

	Socket chatSocket = new Socket("127.0.0.1" , 5000)
	
	- "127.0.0.1"is the IP address for "local host", in other words
	the one the code is running on
	
	- 5000 is the port number, which you know because we told you that 5000 is the port
	number for our chat server

2. Make an InputStreamReader chained to the Sockets low-level (connection) input Stream

	InputStreamReader stream = new InputStreamReader(chatSocket.getInputStream());
	
	- InputStreamReader is a bridge between low-level byte stream(like the one coming from the socket) and
	a high-level, character stream (like the BufferedReader were after as out top of the chain stream)
	
	- All we have to do is aSK the socket for an inputStream. its a low-level connection stream, but were
	chaining it to something more text-friendly
	
3.Make a BufferedReader and read!

	BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(stream);
	String message = reader.readLine();
	
	- Chain the BufferedReader to the inputStreamReader (Which was chained to the low-level connection stream we got from the socket)
