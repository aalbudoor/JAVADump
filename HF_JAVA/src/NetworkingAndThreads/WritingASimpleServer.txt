// A socket server which waits for clients request (when a client makes a new socket()) and a plain old socket to use for communications with the 
client


How it works:

1. Server application makes a ServerSocket, on a specific port
	
	ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(4242);
	
	- This starts the server application listening for client
	requests coming in for port 4242.
	
2. Client makes a socket connection to the server application

	Socket sock = new Socket("190.165.1.103", 4242);
	
	- Client knows the IP address and port number
	(published or given to him by whomever configures the server app to be on that port)
	
3. Server makes a new Socket to communicate with this client

	Socket sock = server.accept();
	
	- the accept() method blocks(just sits there) while its waiting for a client Socket connection. When its
	waiting for a client Socket connection. When a client finally tries to connect, the method returns a plain old Socket(on a different port)
	that knows how to communicate with the client (i.e, knows the clients IP address and port number). The socket is on a different 
	port than the serverSocket, so that the ServerSocket can go back to waiting for other clients
