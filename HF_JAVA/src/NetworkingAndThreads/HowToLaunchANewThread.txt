How to launch a new Thread:

1. Make a Runnable object (the threads job)

	Runnable threadJob = new MyRunnable();			//Creates Runnable Object (button)
	
Runnable is an interface, youll write a class that implements the Runnable interface, and that class is where
 youll define the work that a thread will perfrom. In other words, the method that will be run from the threads new call stack
 
 2. Make a Thread object (the worker) and give it a Runnable (the job)
 
 	Thread myThread = new Thread(threadJob);			//creates Thread Object (button)
 	
 pass the new Runnable object to the thread constructor. This tells the new Thread Object which method to put on the bottom of the new stack 
 (the Runnables run() method)
 
 
 3.Start the thread
 
 	myThread.start();		//connects the Thread object with the Runnable object using the run() method 
 	
 Nothing happens until you call the threads start() method. Thats when you go from having just a Thread instance to having a new 
 thread of execution. When the new thread starts up, it takes the Runnable object's run() method and puts it on the bottom of the new threads Stack
