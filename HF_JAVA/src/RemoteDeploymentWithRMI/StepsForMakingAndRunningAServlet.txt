Steps for making and running a Servlet

1.Find out where your servlet needs to be places

- We'll assume we already have a web server up and running, and that its already configured to support servlets. 
The most important thing is to find out exactly where your sevlet class files have to be placed in order for the server to see them. If you
have a web site hosted by an ISP, the hosting service can tell you where to put your
servlets


2. Get the servlets.jar and add it to your class path.

- servlets arent part of the standard java library; you need the servlets classes packaged into the servlets.jar file. you can download the srvelts
classes from java.sun.com, or you can get them from your java-enabled web server. without these classes you wont be 
able to compile your servlets


3. Write a servlet class by extending HttpServlet

	public class MyServletA extends HttpServlet {...}
	

4.Write an HTML page that inkoes your servlet

- when the user clicks a link that refrences your servlet, the web server will find the servlet and invoke the apppropriate method depending on the 
HTTP command (GET,POST etc)

	<a href: "servlets/MyServletA"> this is the most amazing srvlet. </a>
	

5. Make your servlet and HTML page available to your server

- This is completely dependednt on your web server. Your SIP may simply tell uou to dop it into a 'servlets' directory on your web site.
