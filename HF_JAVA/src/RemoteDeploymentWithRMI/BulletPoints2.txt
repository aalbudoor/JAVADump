- Servlets are java classes that run entirely on an HTTP web server

- servlets are useful for running code on the server as a result of client interaction with a web page. 
For i.e if a client submits information in a web page form, the servlet can process the information,
 add it to a database, and send back a customized, confirmation page
 
 - To compile a sevlet, you need the servlet package which are in the servlets.jar file. The servlet classes are not part of the java standard
 libraries, so you need to download the servlets jar from the java.sun.com or get them from a servlet capable web server
 
 - to run a servlet, you must have a web server capable of running servlets, such as the Tomcat server from apache.org
 
 - your servlet must be placed in a location thats specific to your particular web server, 
 so youll need to find that out before you try to run your servlets. If you have a web site hosted by an ISP that 
 supports servlets, the ISP will tell you which directory to place your servlets in
 
 - A typical servlet extends HttpServlet and overrides one or more servlet methods, such as doGet() or doPost()
 
 - The web server starts the servlet and calls the appropriate method (doGEt(0, etc) based on the clients request
 
 - the servlet can send back a response by getting a PrintWriter output stream from the response parameter of the doGet() method
 
 - the servlet writes out an HTML page, complete with tags
