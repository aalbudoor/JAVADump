Step 3: generate stubs and skeletons


1. run rmic on the remote implementation class (not the remote interface)

	go on terminal and write - rmic MyRemoteImpl

- notice that you dont say ".class" in the end. just the class name 

- it spits out two new classes for the helper objects.

- the classes will land on your current directory (i.e whatver you did a cd to). 
- Remember rmic must be able to see your implementations is
