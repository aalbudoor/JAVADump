How does the client get the stub object?

- the client has to get the stub object, since thats the ting the client will call methods on. And thats where the RMI registery comes in.
 The client does a 'Look up', like going to the white pages of a phone book, and essentially says
 "Here is a name and id like the stub that goes with the name"
 
 
 	MyRemote service = (MyRemote) Naming.lookup("rmi://127.0.0.1/Remote Hello");
 	
 - The client alwasy uses the remote implementation as the type of the service. In fact, the client nevr needs to know the actual class name of you
 remote service
 
 - you have to cast it to the interface, since the look up method returns type object.
 
 - the lookup() is a static method of the Naming class
 
 - your host name or IP address
 
 - after the host name or IP address you must include the name that the service was registered under
