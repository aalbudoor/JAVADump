- Java web start technology lets you deploy a stand-alone client application

- java web start includes a 'helper app' that must be installed on the client (along with java)

- a Java web start (JWS) app has two pieces: an executable JAR and a .jnlp file

- a .jnlp file is a simple xml document that describes your JWS application. it includes tags for specifying the name and location of the JAR,
and the name of the class wiht the main() method 

- When a browser gets a .jnlp file from the server (because the user clicked on a link to the .jnlp file), the browser starts up the JWS helper app.

- the JWS helper app reads the .jnlp file and requests the executable JAR from the web server.

- When the JWS gets the JAR, it inokes the main() method (specified in the .jnlp file)
