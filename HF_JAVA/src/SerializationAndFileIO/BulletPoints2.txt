- to write a text file, start with a FileWriter connection Stream

- Chain the FileWriter to a BufferedWriter for efficiency.

- A File Object repersents a file at a particular path, but does not repersent the actual contents of the file

- With a File Object you can create, traverse, and delte directories

- Most streams that can use a String filename can use a File objcet as well, and a file object can be safer to use

- to read a text file, start with a FileReader connection Stream.

- chain the fileReader to a bufferedReader for efficiency

- To parse a text file, you need to be sure the file is written with some way to recognize the 
different elements. A common approach is to use some kind of character to seperate the individual pieces

- Use the String split() method to split a String up into individual tokens. A string with one seperator will have two tokens, one 
on each side of the seperator. The seperator doesnt count as a token
