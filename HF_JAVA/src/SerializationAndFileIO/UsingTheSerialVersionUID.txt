-Each time an object is serialized, the object (including every object in its graph) is 'stamped' with
a version ID number for the objects class.

The ID is called the serialVersionId.

- as An object is being deserialized, if the class has changed since the object was serialized, the class could have a different serialVersionUID,
and deserialization will fail!!


Steps:

- when you think your class might evolve after someone has serialized objects from it....

1. Use the serialver command-line tool to get the versionID for your class


2. paste te output into your class

	public class Dog {
	
		static fila long serialVersionUID = 
											-6543297473910L;
											
		private String name;
		private int size;
		
		//method code here
	}
	
3. Be sure that when you make changes to the class, you take responsibility in your code for the consequences
of the changes you made to the class! for example, be sure that your new Dog class can deal with an old Dog being deserialized with defualt values
for instance variables added to the class after the Dog was serialized
