1. Make a FileOutputStream

//Make a fileOutputStream object. fileOutputStream knows how to connect to (and create) a file 
//If the file "MyGame.ser" doesnt exist it will be created automatically

FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream("MyGame.ser");

2.Make an ObjectOutputStream

//ObjectOutputStream lets you write objects, but it cant directly connect to a file. it needs to be fed a helper

ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(fileStream);

3.Write the Object
//serializes the object refrenced by character one, character two, character three, and write them to the file "MyGamer.ser"

os.writeObject(characterOne);
os.writeObject(characterTwo);
os.writeObject(characterThree);

4.Close the ObjectOutputStream
//Closing the stream at the top closes the ones underneath, so the FileOutputStream (and the file) will close automatically

os.close();
