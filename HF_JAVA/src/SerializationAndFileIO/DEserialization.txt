//Deserialization is alot like serialization but in reverse

1.Make a FileinputStream

FileInput stream fileStream = new FileInputStream("MyGame.ser")		//If the file "MyGame.ser" doesnt exist, youll get an exception


2. Make an ObjectInputStream

ObjectInputStream os = new ObjectInputStream(fileStream); 	//ObjectInputStream lets you read objects, but it cant directly connect to a file
															//it needs to be chained to a connection stream, In this case a FileInputStream

3. read the Objects

Object one = os.readObject();
Object two = os.readObject();			//Each time you say readObject(), you get the next object in the stream. so youll read them back in
Object three = os.readObject();		//the same order in which they were written. Youll get a exception if you try to read more objects that you wrote

4.Cast the Objects

GameCharacter elf = (GameCharacter) one;
GameCharacter troll = (GameCharacter) two;				//The return value of readObject() is type Object (just like with ArrayList)
GameCharacter wizard = (GameCharacter) three;			//So you will have to cast it back to the type you know it really is 


5.Close the ObjectInout

os.close()		//closing the stream at the top closes the ones underneath, so the FileInputStream (and the file) will close immediately
