//Mark an instance variable as transient if it cant (or shouldnt) be saved

//If you want an instance variable to be skipped by the serialization process, mark the variable with the
//'transient' keyword.


import java.net.*;

class Chat implements Serializable {
		
		transient String currentID;
		
		String userName;
		
		//more code
	
	}
	
- transient says, dont save this variable during serialization, just skip it"

- userNAme variable will be saved as part of the objects state during serialization

- If you have an instance variable that cant be saved because it isnt serializable, you can mark that variable with the transient
keyword and the serialization process will skip right over it.


- So why would a variable not be serializable?

- it could be the class designer simply forgot to make the class implement Serializable. or since you cant save network connections, threads or 
file objects
