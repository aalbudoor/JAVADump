If you pass a Comparator to the sort() method, the sort order is determined by the Comparator rather than the elements own comapreTo() method 


-- Rules are

1. Invoking the one-argument 'sort(List o) method means the list elements compareTo(0 method determines the order. So the elements in the list
MUST implement the comparable operator


2. Invoking sort(List o, Comparator c) means the list elements compareTo() method will NOT be called, and the Comparators compare() method will
be used instead. That means the elemnts in the list do NOT need to implement the comparable interface.
