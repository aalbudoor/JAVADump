- List (when sequesnce matters)

Collections that know about index position

List know where something is in the list. You can have more than one element referencing the same object 


- Set (when uniqueness matters)

Collections that do not allow duplicates

Sets know whether something is already in the collection. You can never have more that one element refrencing the same object (or more than one
element refrencing two objects that are considered equal)


- Map (When finding something by key matters)

Collections that use key-value pairs

Maps know the value associated with a given key. You can have two keys that refrence the same value, but you cannot have duplicate
keys. Although keys are typically String names (So that you can make name/value property lists, for example) a key can be any object
